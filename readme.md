## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. For open-source projects, GitHub Actions offers several benefits:

*   **Automation:** Automates repetitive tasks such as running tests, linting code, and building releases.
*   **CI/CD:** Enables continuous integration by automatically building and testing code with every push and pull request, and facilitates continuous delivery by automating deployments.
*   **Code Quality:** Helps maintain code quality by running linters and other code analysis tools automatically.

In this project, we plan to implement the following GitHub Actions workflows:

*   **CI for Tests:** This workflow will automatically run the test suite on every push and pull request to ensure that new changes don't break existing functionality.
*   **Linting:** This workflow will automatically run a linter to check for code style consistency and potential errors.
